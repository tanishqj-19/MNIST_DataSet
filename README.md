# MNIST_DataSet


# Introduction
This project is a machine learning project that uses the MNIST dataset to perform image classification. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify these images.

# Classifiers used
In this project, several classifiers were used including Decision Trees, random Forests, and Support Vector Machines. However, the one that gave the highest accuracy was the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

# Results
The results of this project were remarkable, with an accuracy of over 97% achieved using the KNN classifier.


# Conclusion
This project was a great learning experience and provided a deeper understanding of the KNN algorithm and how it can be applied to image classification tasks. If you are interested in learning more about machine learning and image classification, this project is a great starting point.
